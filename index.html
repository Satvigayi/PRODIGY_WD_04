                    <h3>Hotel Management System in C</h3>
                    <p>This project, completed during my first year, was a comprehensive Hotel Management System developed in C. It involved designing a user-friendly interface to manage hotel bookings, customer check-ins and check-outs, and billing. This project helped me grasp the fundamentals of programming, data structures, and memory management in C.</p>

                    <h3>Student Management System in Python</h3>
                    <p>During the first semester of my second year, I developed a Student Management System using Python. This project involved creating a system to manage student records, including adding, updating, and deleting student information. It featured a graphical user interface built with Tkinter, and it significantly improved my understanding of Python and GUI development.</p>

                    <h3>Online Job Portal in MERN</h3>
                    <p>In the second semester of my second year, I developed an Online Job Portal using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project aimed to connect job seekers with potential employers through a seamless and interactive platform. It enhanced my skills in full-stack development and provided me with hands-on experience in building scalable web applications.</p>
